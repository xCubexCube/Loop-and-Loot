Before launching the project you'll need the KinectFace API dll and database files copied to the Binaries folder.

1: Make sure you've already installed the Kinect SDK from Microsoft

2: Navigate to C:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Kinect\v2.0_1409\Redist\Face\x64

3: Copy 'NuiDatabase' and 'Kinect20.Face.dll'

4: In the project folder, go to 'Binaries\Win64' (create those folders if not existent) and paste the previously copied folder and files.
